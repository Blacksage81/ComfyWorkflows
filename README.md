# ComfyWorkflows
A back up for interesting Comfyui Graphs that I've built, found online, or reverse engineered


Note on Prompting Style
I prefer the means in which Automatic1111 handles prompting so therefore most of the workflows featured will have A1111 Clip Encoders. I think FaceForge Ancestral uses the default SDXL Clip Encoders

Headshotter T2I + Control Net, a slightly upgraded version of a graph built after following a Youtube tutorial, feel free to download the provided busts for ease of use. leave the depth settings as they are for the intended effect.
